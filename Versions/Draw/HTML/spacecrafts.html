                                        When Earth and Mars are in alignment. Previous sentence is description for the best launching position to the Mars. Earth is the third closest planet to the sun and Mars is the fourth, which influences the orbits of the planets around the sun as well as the number of days that equal a year on each planet. For example, Earth is moving at a pretty fast clip of 67,000 miles per hour as it orbits the sun -- which creates our 365-day orbit. But Mars is farther from the sun, so it's slower and takes longer.
                                    </h2>
                                    <h2 class = "smallerDevices">
                                        The planets aren't moving in perfect circular paths around the sun, either. Instead, they have elliptical, or more oval-shaped, orbits. And Mars' orbit is tugged on by massive gas giant Jupiter, which can change the orbit shape as well. Mars and Earth are also slightly tilted in their orbits. But every 26 months, Mars and Earth end up in a nice alignment on the same side of the sun and are closer together than usual. Launches to Mars are targeted at this time because any spacecraft leaving Earth will experience a shorter trip to Mars -- which means less resources such as fuel are needed as well. Other factors, like the lift capability of the launch vehicle, the mass of the spacecraft and landing time, also help determine the launch window.

                                            Like Earth, Mars has ice caps at its poles. Water reaches the poles as vapor and is frozen into thin layers that build up thick deposits. Mixed with this water is dust picked up by the wind, so the caps have bright and dark layers of "clean" and "dirty" ice. During winter at each pole, temperatures are so low that carbon dioxide freezes from the atmosphere and forms additional layers of "dry ice." Much water is also trapped as permafrost surrounding the polar regions.

                                            Like Earth, Mars spins on an axis tilted about 25 degrees from its orbital plane. Mars has no large satellite like the Moon, just its two small moons Phobos and Deimos. As a result, the tug of gravity from the Sun and the large planets causes a slow wobble in the tilt, or obliquity, of its axis. During periods of higher obliquity, the atmosphere is thicker, dust storms are more intense, and water now trapped at the poles moves to the equatorial region to form mountain glaciers. Many glacial landforms from the last time this occurred can still be seen on Mars. It’s not surprising, that Martian ice and snow tend to be dusty, more so than ice or snow on Earth. Researchers from two universities in the U.S. announced a new study showing just how dusty Mars ice really is.

                                            Launched successfully on 30 July. It's about Perseverance Rover, one of the most advanced in last decade. The rover will be the first mission ever to attempt to collect rock samples for return to Earth; it will also search for signs of ancient alien life, launch the first helicopter on the red planet and use microphones to capture Mars’s sounds for the first time. The rover blasted into the skies above Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard an Atlas V rocket at 7.50 a.m. local time.

                                            The machine is a beefed-up version of the Curiosity rover, which gripped the world when it landed on Mars 8 years ago in a nail-biting 7-minute manoeuvre. After a journey of roughly 500 million kilometres, Perseverance will hit the Martian atmosphere travelling at around 19,500 kilometres per hour. It will deploy a parachute and then a ‘sky crane’ system — similar to that used by Curiosity — that will fire retrorockets to slow it down as it approaches the planet’s surface. Unlike Curiosity, the spacecraft has an autopiloting system to detect obstacles such as big rocks, and guide it to a safe location. Jezero means ‘lake’ in several Slavic languages. More than 3.8 billion years ago, a river flowed into the 45-kilometre-wide crater, and lake waters filled it.

                                            India's Mars Orbiter - seven years in orbit. For space related missions - it's huge amount of time. Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan (Hindi: “Mars Craft”), unmanned mission to Mars that is India’s first interplanetary spacecraft. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched the Mars Orbiter Mission on November 5, 2013, using its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sriharikota Island, Andhra Pradesh state.

                                            The Indian government approved the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) project in August 2012, a mere 15 months before launch. ISRO was able to keep mission costs down by basing MOM’s design on that of Chandrayaan-1, India’s first Moon probe. Because the PSLV did not have the power to place the 1,350-kg (3,000-pound) probe on a direct trajectory, the spacecraft used low-power thrusters to raise its orbit over a period of four weeks until it broke free of Earth’s gravity on December 1 and headed to Mars. It arrived at Mars on September 24, 2014, and the spacecraft entered a highly elliptical orbit of 423 × 80,000 km (262 × 50,000 miles), which allows it to take pictures of one entire Martian hemisphere at a time. MOM arrived at Mars in time to observe Comet Siding Spring.

                                            Perseverance landed on surface of the Mars. The mission provides opportunities to learn and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of future human expeditions to Mars. That includes testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, and other environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars.

                                            Perseverance has landed in the 45km-wide Jezero Crater. Just like Gale crater, the location for NASA's other current rover Curiosity, Jezero is the site of a suspected ancient lake and river delta. As water is an extremely important part of the existence of all known life on Earth, anywhere it could be found on Mars – whether in the modern day or in the ancient past – is a good place to be looking for evidence of life on the planet. Just as geologists here on Earth would take samples of rocks from various places around a region to study them, Perseverance will take and analyse samples using a sophisticated 'chemistry set', the results of which are transmitted back to the scientists here on Earth. All four science objectives relate to searching for signs of life on Mars.

                                            When Earth and Mars are in alignment. Previous sentence is description for the best launching position to the Mars. Earth is the third closest planet to the sun and Mars is the fourth, which influences the orbits of the planets around the sun as well as the number of days that equal a year on each planet. For example, Earth is moving at a pretty fast clip of 67,000 miles per hour as it orbits the sun -- which creates our 365-day orbit. But Mars is farther from the sun, so it's slower and takes longer.
                                        &lt/h2>

                                            The planets aren't moving in perfect circular paths around the sun, either. Instead, they have elliptical, or more oval-shaped, orbits. And Mars' orbit is tugged on by massive gas giant Jupiter, which can change the orbit shape as well. Mars and Earth are also slightly tilted in their orbits. But every 26 months, Mars and Earth end up in a nice alignment on the same side of the sun and are closer together than usual. Launches to Mars are targeted at this time because any spacecraft leaving Earth will experience a shorter trip to Mars -- which means less resources such as fuel are needed as well. Other factors, like the lift capability of the launch vehicle, the mass of the spacecraft and landing time, also help determine the launch window.

                                            Mars Mission From the U.A.E. One of the richest country in the Middle East, has a strong space exploration ambitions. It's been a full year since the United Arab Emirates made history when its first-ever interplanetary mission slipped into orbit around Mars. The Emirates Mars Mission, also called Hope, launched in July 2020, arrived at the Red Planet seven months later and successfully entered orbit around Mars on Feb. 9, 2021. After a few months in orbit, the mission began its science observations.

                                            In fact, one of the mission's first findings came from data gathered even before the spacecraft entered its formal science observation program. Hope observations confirmed that an elusive phenomenon called the discrete aurora is taking place on the planet's night side. Hope's primary mission is planned to last one Martian year (687 Earth days). That timeline is important because mission scientists want to understand how weather and climate work across the entire planet both throughout a day and throughout a year. For example, Al Matroushi said that the team has been studying water cloud features that appear to grow at the beginning and end of the day. The spacecraft is also designed to help scientists understand how the layers of Mars' atmosphere interact.
